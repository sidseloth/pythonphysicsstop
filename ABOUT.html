      <p>I am <span class="programmer">programmer</span> and a <span class="webdesigner">web designer.</span> A very formal introduction of every web developer, but this certainly does not define who I am .<br>My purpose, my work and my philosophy defines me. My purpose in life is to deliver a positive impact on the society in the form of tech,<br> cause that's all I know. It's very important to have a <span class="purpose">PURPOSE</span> in life so that one can set goals and drive you towards them.<br>The purpose of buiding the website was to offer a corroboration of how real life problems that involve physics can be solved using a chunk of code.<br> This chunk of code can calculate really large numbers to offer a result. My purpose had set my goals of learning HTML,CSS,JS and Python.<br> This journey is just the beginning; I will fail in not writing proper code, poor design, unordered layout and the list can go on and on<br> but will definitely learn, gain experience and become a better version of myself</p>
