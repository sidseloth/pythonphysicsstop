     <h2>Example : A box is pulled at a constant speed of 0.40 m/s across a frictional surface. Perform an extensive analysis of the diagram below to determine the values for the blanks.</h2>
      <p>Solution: First use the mass to determine the force of gravity.<br>

Fgrav = m • g = (20 kg) • (9.8 m/s/s) = 196 N<br>
Now find the vertical component of the applied force using a trigonometric function.<br>

Fy = (80 N) • sine (45 degrees) = 56.7 N<br>
Thus, Fnorm =139.3 N in order for the vertical forces to balance.<br>

The horizontal component of the applied force can be found as<br>

Fx = (80 N) • cosine (45 degrees) = 56.7 N<br>
Since the speed is constant, the horizontal forces must also balance; and so Ffrict = 56.7 N.<br>

The value of "mu" can be found using the equation<br>

"mu"= Ffrict / Fnorm = (56.7 N) / (139.3 N) = 0.406.</p>
